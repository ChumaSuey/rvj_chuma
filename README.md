### General Information / Behind the scenes.

#### Map

For a while an idea to make Quake Champions “Corrupted Keep” has been in my pocket for a long time, having the remix jam as an experience i figured that i needed some changes to make an actual decent map on it while keeping it Chumastic and everyone can say whether is good or bad but to attain to the Chumatastic feel! (i don’t mind if my maps are Chumastic or Chumatastic both words sound cool)

First i decided just to use the layout in my favor and not making it a devoted copy and paste, i’m going to talk about myself good and say that with Remix jam i figured i can by eye and reference copy a place in Trenchbroom but that of course means nothing if it isn’t “Quake fun”.

This was along a small process where i printed the Quake Champions map by Church of Quake site and i used my colored pens to figure out how the map should go in concept.

Keeping the use the layout and make the map have it’s own merit and spirit, i realized gameplay-wise the map couldn’t be fully open-path since it would happen the same of my Remix jam map, in the middle of it with the help of the printed layouts i decided to block the Spinal Hall and Nodens outcropping and making them the climax zones, so the player backtracks to a newly created area (that doesn’t exist in the original map) to fight Chthon.

The Chthon fight was an improvisation but after doing it for the Quake from memory jam, a Killable Chthon entity should be fun to play with at least… the map was then ready.

The texture of the Hooks were changed based on Em3rald’s feedback, i used rm_mechanics.wad tech one (the one i improvised from makkon textures didn’t have animations).

The reason why i used Malice Quake track in the end was because it's my favorite Quake Intermission screen track... i believe it worked as a victory song.

#### Music production

The map had to attain to be aggresive fight focused because it’s short, i decided to create the songs since i was starting practicing FL Studio… Electric Lava Compactor was my second song in history ever being made… From QC soundtrack , Goroth - Chris Vrenna i imported the notes of the guitar of the original song into ELC, basically i listened to the songs, recreated it in Piano and polished them in FL Studio and got to keep working on the song. (DevSEB in the master added a some Kicks that were amazing, i appreciate his creativity here)

Electric Lava Hopper the intro was made in 20 minutes in the morning after i started doing my daily routine, had to stay in energy i composed it as a small intro instead of having the song play action rhythm from the beginning.

Electric Lava Disposal was made in 1 or 2 days i can’t remember, but i always had the focus the song was made to fight against Chthon, so after you grab the key, the song plays… the concrete idea was an action focused song and there’s no FX sounds in it (in other songs i’ve made there are more but this one had none).
